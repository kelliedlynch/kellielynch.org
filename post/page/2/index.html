        <p>Something has been biting us at night, and I have no idea what. It seems most likely that it's either bedbugs or fleas. However, I've thoroughly inspected the mattress and found no signs whatsoever of bedbugs, and the bites aren't in the common "three in a row" pattern that bedbugs usually do. As for fleas, our cats are indoor-only, and they're treated for fleas anyway. I bought a flea comb and combed them several times, and found nothing. No fleas, no eggs.</p>

<p>Not knowing what we're up against, I've declared war on everything crawly. The mattress is now in a bedbug-proof cover. The carpets in every room have been thoroughly vacuumed and shampooed with near-boiling water. All bedding has been run through a hot wash cycle, and I'm working on the clothes as well. Everything goes into a plastic garbage bag after it's washed, and all the bags are sitting in a non-carpeted room. I sprayed flea spray on every carpet and practically soaked the couch with it. I've ordered some diatomaceous earth and a duster, and plan to apply that stuff to every nook and cranny I can find.</p>

<p>I was pretty disappointed when, having done all the vacuuming and shampooing and spraying in my bedroom yesterday, I still woke up with new bites today. I finished up the rest of the house today, so if I have bites tomorrow morning...well, we're clearly up against some kind of superbug, and our only hope will be kryptonite, or nuking the house from orbit.</p>

<p>I think the most frustrating thing about all this is not even knowing what I'm fighting. If I could find a bug, or evidence of an infestation, I'd be able to take targeted actions against that specific bug. Currently the only evidence of anything is the bites, and they don't tell me much, apart from that I hate biting bugs.</p>

        <p>I'm about 90% sure that two older children were hitting my two-year-old in the Chick-Fil-A play area today. She came out of a tunnel or slide crying twice, and the older children hid while I comforted her. My daughter doesn't generally cry unless she's hurt or throwing a tantrum, and this definitely wasn't tantrum crying. Then she was acting like she was afraid to go back in the playground until the older children left. On the way out, one of them shook his fist at her.</p>

<p>I couldn't very well yell at these kids; they're not mine, and I didn't actually see it happening. And when their mother showed up to take them home, I didn't want to bring it up with her. After all, I don't want to be one of <strong>those</strong> parents, whose children are always perfect angels while other children are always monsters. There was, after all, a chance that I'd be blaming innocent kids for a couple of totally accidental bumps or trips.</p>

<p>Still, as I held her, her tears soaking into my shoulder, I couldn't shake the feeling I was somehow failing her as a parent. My sweet little girl had been treated unjustly, and I wasn't doing a damn thing about it. I could only stroke her head and tell her that it would be okay.</p>

        <p>A few years ago I started collecting absurd classified ads. I had plans for a website, but it turned out I couldn't find enough of them to post several times a week. I figured I might as well post them here.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2011/08/two-vibrators.jpg" /></p>

<p>How does one go about buying used vibrators, anyway? Do you get to do a test drive? Oh well, I wanted to get some paintings anyway--might as well kill two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>What I loved best about this ad was that it ran again a couple weeks later, this time without the miscellaneous household goods. Hope springs eternal.</p>

        <p>I'm trying to get back into the theatre. I had my first audition in years today.</p>

<p>I flubbed the song pretty badly. I was so nervous that my voice wavered and cracked, and my pitch was off. The director stopped me after the first verse and had me do some scales instead. I screwed up a line early in my monologue, and about three quarters of the way through, my mind went completely blank. I felt the absurd urge to call "Line!" The director had me start over again, but this time with a Jersey accent. My Jersey accent was weak to begin with, and turned into a southern accent after a couple of lines.</p>

<p>It. Was. Awful.</p>

<p>I'm glad I did it, though. I need to get used to this if I really want to get on stage again. I've always hated auditions, but then, I'd never done enough of them to get comfortable with them.</p>

<p>There was talk of me perhaps being stage manager, though. I'm excited about the possibility, but I'd be a little relieved if it fell through--rehearsals are nearly an hour away. Still, if I'm looking for a way to get reacquainted with the theatre, this would be ideal...and fun.</p>

<p>In other news, I might have a date on Saturday. I'm meeting someone, but we haven't explicitly stated it's a date. We seem pretty compatible; I suppose if I meet him and find I'm physically attracted to him, I'll unilaterally declare it a date. So there.</p>

        <p>I've been rediscovering watercolors lately. I used to really enjoy working with watercolor pencils, but hadn't done much with just brush and paint. I did this just to play with colors and shapes, and kind of get used to the medium:</p>

<object width="450" height="549" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="flashvars" value="id=253062549&width=1337" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://backend.deviantart.com/embed/view.swf" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed width="450" height="549" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://backend.deviantart.com/embed/view.swf" flashvars="id=253062549&width=1337" allowScriptAccess="always" allowscriptaccess="always" /></object>

<p>Yesterday my husband woke me with the news that my 2-year-old daughter had found my newest in-progress painting and "improved" it. Specifically, she had assumed it was a coloring book page that needed some more color, so she took a red colored pencil to it. As anyone who has worked with colored pencils knows, they do NOT erase well. Especially when applied with the grace and finesse of a toddler. Here's what it looks like now.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-FwoYnpglHyA/TkmgAugXtNI/AAAAAAAAAJM/nl8gPeO0dG4/h500/autumndance-scribbled-web.jpg" /></p>

<p>I probably should have taken a photo of the piece before I started trying to erase it, but frankly, I wasn't in a very good state of mind to see the humor in the situation. Thankfully, the pencil erased more easily from the bits with more paint on them, so I was able to mostly remove the red from the girl on the bottom. It was harder to remove the red "aura" around her--I had to use an X-acto knife and carefully scrape away the top layer of paper. I just hope that the scraped paper will accept watercolor somewhat uniformly.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Md7VXCVwBxg/TkmgLXsMxyI/AAAAAAAAAJU/EBno3UX2484/s400/autumndance-scribbled-detail.jpg" /></p>

<p>The face is still grainy and red-speckled, and I'm not sure I want to risk trying to fix it. My current plan is to give the entire upper half of the painting up as lost, redo it on another sheet of paper, and Photoshop the whole thing together. Not quite what I was hoping for, but I guess it could have been worse.</p>

<p>She could have gotten hold of my paints.</p>

<p>Dance Dance Revolution is a game that evokes memories of a very specific time in my life. Ten years ago, I played the game nearly every day; I would leave my waitressing job with a pocket full of cash, and drop anywhere between 3 and 10 dollars into one of the many machines in the area. I even played in a couple of tournaments. Though there was a lot going wrong in my life at the time, it's a time I look back on with fondness, mainly because of the friends I had.</p>

<p>I stopped playing when I moved somewhere without a convenient arcade, and quickly got out of the habit. Over the years, I tried to relive the DDR experience when I came across one of the increasingly rare machines, but found my endurance disappointing and the condition of the machines even more so. One broken sensor can make harder songs physically impossible to pass, and until a couple days ago, I hadn't seen a DDR game with all its sensors working in years.</p>

<p>When I saw that machine a couple days ago, I got on it and was amazed when I didn't fail instantly. All the jogging I've been doing meant endurance wasn't an issue at all. I played as many games as I could before we had to leave, feeling like I'd found an old friend.</p>

<p>Two days later, an errand took me back to the place I'd first played DDR. It was also the place where my husband and I, before we were married, were shooed away from the parking lot by a security guard because we were having an intense makeout session on the back of my car. The arcade is closed now; an empty storefront in a dead mall, down in the area that was once the food court and now seems to have been converted to a storage area. I walked up to the metal grate and peered inside. No games remained in the space, but the decor was still the same. I saw the place where the DDR machine used to be, and for a moment, I could almost hear the chimes and buzzers of a hundred games, and the cacophany of kids yelling for their parents or each other. I could almost hear the fast, cheery beat of the song that had first lured me in there.</p>

<p>But then it was gone, and only the steady clack-clack of the unused escalator remained, carrying its phantoms somewhere else.</p>

        <p>Dora the Explorer's favorite "silly story" to tell is about the time her two infant siblings escaped from the house and rolled down the hill, and she and her parents had to chase them through some very dangerous terrain to get them back.

<p>I have some serious concerns about this family.</p>

        <p>I've always considered myself a writer, first and foremost. Any time I'm filling out an "About Me" section on anything, "writer" is the first word that comes to mind. I've been having a minor existential crisis for some time now, because despite that strong self-identification, I haven't actually <strong>written</strong> anything in years.</p>

<p>I could come up with a mile-long list of excuses for why I didn't write, but really, the reasons all boil down to: (imagine the whine of a petulant 12-year-old here) <strong>it was hard. </strong>Hard to come up with plots, hard to finish things, hard to find the time to do it...all of this, of course, is no excuse at all, but I pretended it was. For most of my life, writing had been one of the easiest things in the world for me to do, and suddenly it wasn't anymore. Not so much due to any change in my abilities, but to a change in my standards. I wasn't satisfied with writing crap anymore, so I just didn't write.</p>

<p>A while back I finally decided to make writing a major part of my life again. This blog is part of that--a little self-indulgent journaling works pretty well as brain grease. I was a little stuck on the next step, though; after so long without putting pen to paper, I had forgotten how to world-build and how to craft characters, and to be honest, I'm not sure I <strong>ever</strong> knew how to craft a plot. I used to write a lot of short stories and introspective character wanking, but any time I tried to work on a longer piece, I'd get about 5,000 words in and say, "Now what?" My greatest writing achievement had been doing 40,000 words on the same plot, and that had ground to a sudden halt when I suddenly realized that I had no idea whatsoever what was supposed to happen next. I wasn't even sure how the story was supposed to end; I had kind of figured I'd work it out as I went.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.jim-butcher.com/">Jim Butcher</a>. I've enjoyed a lot of his works, and while he's not my favorite author--just about everything of his I've read has annoyed me at some point--he certainly knows how to craft a story. Despite their flaws, his books have kept me up until 3am on multiple occasions, dying to learn how it all turns out in the end. From 2004 to 2008 Jim Butcher wrote a series of articles on how to write a novel, which he posted <a href="http://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/">here</a> on his LiveJournal, of all places. I skimmed them a couple of years ago, thought they were neat, and promptly forgot about them--come on, like I had time to write?</p>

<p>Then a few months ago, I decided I was finally going to do it--I was going to pick one of the half-baked story ideas I had floating around in my head, and fully bake it. My husband reminded me of the Jim Butcher articles, and I went back and read them thoroughly.  And wow, did they ever open my eyes.</p>

<p>The 20-second summary of Jim Butcher's method is this: your story is a series of scenes (in which a question is presented, then answered) and sequels (in which the characters react to what just happened and choose what to do next). A scene question could be as simple as "Will the hero make a sandwich?" The key to the method, is that the answer to that question can never be yes. It must be either "yes, but...", "no", or "no, and furthermore...."</p>

<p>If the question is "Will the hero make a sandwich?", then the answer might be "Yes, but in the process he drops his plate on the floor, shattering it. It turns out that was his last plate." Then in the sequel he reacts (Argh! Damn it, I'm so clumsy!) and chooses what to do next (Better go to the store and buy some more plates.) This leads effortlessly into the next scene (Buying plates at the store.)</p>

<p>I realized, reading that, that just about every time I'd ever gotten stuck while writing, it was because the answers to too many of my scene questions were yes. Yes, the heroes escape from jail and throw off their pursuers...now what? Yes, the hero's mentor agrees to help with his tricky problem...now what? So I pulled out some index cards and started outlining the scraps of plot I'd already put together, using the format Jim Butcher describes. Amazingly, the process was even simpler than I thought it would be. The method really works--breaking down each scene and sequel into the components described helped me see what needed to happen next, and fill in plot holes by solving the problems one little piece at a time. I was reminded of a really good game of Tetris; all the blocks slotting into place, and no square pieces in sight.</p>

<p>I've begun transcribing my plot notecards into a handy electronic format, and jotting down bits of dialogue as they occur to me. Yesterday I took off running and wrote over 1,000 words. By the end of it, my brain hurt, but I felt amazing. For the first time, I feel like I'm actually going to write a novel--there aren't any more obstacles in my way, so the only question now is how long it'll take.</p>

        <p>My husband is off on a week-and-a-half business trip, leaving me alone with our daughter for the longest I've ever been. It's only day two, and I'm unable to fathom how single parents do this for <strong>years. </strong>I love the little rugrat dearly, but sometimes this sight is the most beautiful thing in the world:</p>

<p>She doesn't take a nap every day anymore, which makes times like this even more precious. Silence reigns, I can focus on projects for more than 5 minutes at a time, and I might even have time for a 10-minute catnap myself, as soon as I stop writing this blog entry.</p>

<p>So long.</p>
