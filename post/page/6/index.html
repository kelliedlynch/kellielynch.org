        <p>Here's another project I've been working on in my spare time (ha!).</p>

<p>The concept is a t-shirt store that works on a pre-order basis. Every week, I post 1 to 3 new t-shirt designs, with an ordering deadline. If enough pre-orders come in, the shirt is printed and shipped out, and if not, all the orders are refunded (with an option to pick a different shirt instead, of course). Buyers get a truly limited-edition shirt (since each one only has one print run), and because I don't have to pay to have the shirts printed ahead of time, I can keep the per-shirt cost as low as possible. The plan is to offer all the shirts at $10 each.</p>

<p>I'm calling it Half Jackson, because Andrew Jackson is on the $20 bill, and all the shirts are....half a Jackson. Get it? Eh? Eh? Ah, I slay me.</p>

<p>So anyway, my good friend <a href="http://www.horizonscape.com/delphinity">Christina</a> is doing the design work for me. She sent me some logo ideas a while ago, and I finally got around to reviewing them today. I'm absolutely loving this one:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2009/12/hjlogo.png" /></p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, but I could totally see that guy as a youngish, hipster Andrew Jackson. It makes me giggle.</p>

<p>We've still got to do a little back-and-forth on revisions, and I've got a lot of CSS wrangling ahead of me, but I'm hopeful that I'll be able to launch the web site in a month or so. Which probably means I'll actually do it next July.</p>

        <p>It's no secret to those who know me that I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoi">yaoi</a> fan, but it's not something I talk about much, and even though there was a yaoi convention--<a href="http://www.bishiecon.com/">Bishie Con</a>--here in St. Louis recently, I didn't go. To see why, you need only look at the cover of the current <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/">Riverfront Times</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2009/12/rft-bishie-con.jpg" /></p>

<p>Despite calling it the Midwest's "ickiest" anime party, the article paints a reasonably accurate picture of the whole scene. You can read it <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2009-12-09/news/girls-who-love-boys-who-love-boys-inside-midwest-first-celebration-yaoi-screaming-never-stops/">here</a> if you like. However, when I cracked open that issue, I nearly started foaming at the mouth before I even got to the article, and here's why:<br/>
<a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/slideshow/view/28914039/7"><img src="/uploads/2009/12/inside-bishie-con.4188819.36.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>For anyone who might not know, that's a girl whacking another girl on the butt with a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryoko/28082898/">yaoi paddle</a>. A few years ago, an enterprising businessman decided to print "YAOI" on some wooden paddles and sell them for $40 a pop, and now the detestable things have become something of an unofficial symbol of the whole genre. I couldn't hate them more if I tried.</p>

<p>What does a paddle have to do with yaoi? Diddly squat, that's what. Sure, there's plenty of yaoi stories out there with BDSM themes--the same is true of standard heterosexual romance stories, but you don't see women walking around romance novel conventions toting whips with "Regency" printed on the handle. How about historical handcuffs? Contemporary ball gags?</p>

<p>To be fair, I can understand why fans buy these paddles. They're highly visible signs--when you see a fellow paddle-wielder, you know that the two of you have something in common, and that common interest can facilitate the sort of instant friendship between strangers that convention-goers remember fondly for years.</p>

<p>But if I could take every yaoi paddle in the world and fire them into the sun, instantly incinerating every last one of the damn things, I would do it in a heartbeat. The biggest problem with these paddles (apart from the fact they're tacky and overpriced) is that they're the only exposure that many non-fans have to the entire genre. Non-fans go to anime conventions, and they see girls screaming at the top of their lungs, waving paddles around and whacking strangers on the butt with them. How likely do you think the average person is to research what yaoi is <em>really</em> about after that kind of introduction? Not bloody likely.</p>

<p>If these paddles were only being used as signs, I'd still find them tacky, but I wouldn't be as rabidly against them as I am. However, I struggle to recall any convention I've been to in the last five years where I <strong>didn't</strong> see someone whacking someone else with a paddle. A few anime conventions have gone so far as to <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=116820&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=45">ban paddles</a> from their premises, and attendees have <a href="http://board.otakon.com/index.php?showtopic=12835">asked</a> for bans at many more. When <a href="http://www.yaoicon.com/code-of-conduct.html">even Yaoi-con doesn't allow them</a>, you know there's a problem.</p>

<p>I read yaoi stories because I enjoy the romance; because there's an element of dangerous, forbidden love that isn't present in a lot of hetero romance. Your hero has the traditional obstacles to overcome when pursuing his love, plus a few more: does he swing that way? What will our friends think? Oh, we mustn't! It's delightfully cheesy and unrealistic, but it's fun to read anyway. I've been asked before where the abuse and paddling comes in, and it was a struggle to try to explain that <strong>it doesn't</strong>.</p>

<p>It's hard enough trying to explain my hobby to someone who's genuinely interested and open-minded, let alone someone who's been accosted by a hyperactive teenager trying to bludgeon people with a wooden oar. I'm sick of people assuming I'm a borderline-Asperger's case with violent tendencies just because I think Johnny Depp should have kissed Orlando in that pirate movie.</p>

<p>If you really want to announce your love of yaoi to the world, how about a t-shirt or something--you know, those things normal, well-adjusted people use to broadcast their interests and hobbies? I hear they're all the rage.</p>

<p>This yarn was an absolute pleasure to work with, which is a good thing, since I need to unravel another skein of it now.</p>

<p>I still have a bunch of items to list, but David is out of town this week, leaving me to look after the baby on my own. It's hard to find time to sit at the computer when the little one is getting more and more mobile every day...and more and more fascinated with the cats' food dish.</p>

        <p>(And everyone else, really.)</p>

<p>Stop using Papyrus. Please.</p>

<p>Yeah, I get that you don't want to use a plain typeface, but it brands you forever in the minds of anyone who cares about design as someone who can't afford a graphic designer and can't be bothered to type "free fonts" into Google. It's bad enough seeing Papyrus being used for headings and body text, but even worse is when I see it in a logo. Your logo should be distinctive; it should be unique to your business and immediately recognizable. The problem with Papyrus is that it's immediately recognizable...as Papyrus. It's been used by so many yoga studios and in so many high school Geography reports that if you use it to represent your business, nobody will ever associate your logo with you.</p>

<p>It's even more unforgivable when you know the company using Papyrus <strong>can</strong> afford a graphic designer, but that dreaded font rears its ugly head anyway. I'm talking about you, Olive Garden, 20th Century Fox, and Arizona Tea. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_%28typeface%29">Even the font's creator</a> thinks it's overused, you guys--surely you can do better.</p>

<p>I know I'm <a href="http://iheartpapyrus.com/">hardly the first person</a> to complain about this, but it seems like in the last couple of months I've been seeing this poor unsuspecting font abused more and more. Please stop. It deserves better. <strong>You</strong> deserve better. (And don't think I won't notice if you go running to Blackadder or Bradley Hand instead. Have an ounce of pride, will you?)</p>
