        <p>Via <a href="http://www.mymoneyblog.com/virgin-mobile-25-a-month-plan-w-data-price-increase-on-july-20th.html">My Money Blog</a>, I learned that the Virgin Mobile $25 a month phone/data plan I love so much will be going up to $35 on July 20th. This is for new customers only; anyone who signs up before July 20th can keep the awesome $25 rate.</p>

<p>The husband and I both switched to Virgin a few months ago, and we've been more than happy with it. We don't use our phones as <strong>phones</strong> very often--we both got the <a href="http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phones/lg-optimus-v-phone.jsp">LG Optimus V</a>, and we spend far more time tinkering around on the internet than calling people, so the 300 minute a month limit is no problem at all. I don't think either of us has come anywhere near it yet. But the convenience of having a smartphone--of having Google searches and a fully-functioning GPS unit in my pocket at all times--makes me wonder how I ever lived without one.</p>

<p>So if you've been considering making the switch to an Android phone, you really ought to check out Virgin before this gets away. $25 a month is a shockingly good value, especially for a no-contract month-to-month plan.</p>

        <p>This is really refreshing. I didn't know Margaret Cho was poly (or that she was married, honestly), but this is a great way to find out. She talks about it very openly and comfortably, and just seems to have a very reasonable, level-headed approach in general.</p>

<p>I'm amused at the way the other ladies are <em>almost</em> on board with all this, right up until she says "my husband's girlfriend"--then it's a little too much to handle, and a change of subject comes shortly afterward.</p>

    <div class="entry-content">
    
        <p>A couple of weeks ago, I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NRY6R2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=allispar-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B001NRY6R2">Fat Head</a>, a sort of rebuttal documentary to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVBO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=allispar-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B0002OXVBO">Super Size Me</a>. The filmmaker, Tom Naughton, told an entertaining story and made a lot of good points, but I found it a little frustratingly hypocritical. The point of the whole documentary seemed to be that Morgan Spurlock had his own agenda when making Super Size Me, and his premise was flawed. Fat Head set out to prove that one could eat nothing but fast food and not gain weight or have a heart attack, and while I think that point is proven quite well, the hypocrisy is that one can easily see that Naughton has his own agenda: promoting a low-carb diet. There isn't anything wrong with having an agenda, but in this case it feels like a bit of a bait-and-switch--I was lured in with the debunking, but instead I got promotion of a specific lifestyle.</p>

<p>The documentary may have been a bit flawed, but it did start to convince me.  I've been researching low-carb/ketogenic diets since seeing the movie, and though I used to consider them a stupid fad, I see now that the science is pretty sound. I decided to give it a try--go cold turkey on the carbs to burn off a little weight and cure my addiction to breads and refined sugars.</p>

<p>My plan, inasmuch as I have a plan, is to do a full-on ketogenic diet for a while (I'm not sure how long--I guess until I notice a visible difference in my figure), then slowly increase carbs to the point where I can enjoy a bowl of ice cream or rice without having to eat nothing but beef jerky for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>According to a calculator I found (which I can't for the life of me find again), I have a limit of 27 grams of carbs a day, based on my weight, age, and activity level. My first comment about the diet is that this is really difficult to accomplish. Bread and potatoes are a staple of fast food, which we eat for lunch most days, and pasta is a staple of our pantry. Pasta with some manner of sauce is my go-to dinner when I'm feeling uninspired. Or if I'm feeling especially lazy, a carryout pizza special. Keeping it under 27 grams requires a radical change in lifestyle.</p>

<p>Apart from the difficulty of sticking to the carb limit, though, it's a relatively easy diet to stick to. Though I still have to deprive myself of stuff I want, overall I feel far less deprived than I have on other diets. My fridge is full of butter, bacon, cream, steak, and cheese--and I can eat as much as I want of this stuff! I did pick up some Atkins-branded snacks for when I'm seriously craving sweets; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U621CG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=allispar-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B003U621CG">chocolate cookies</a> are surprisingly good.</p>

<p>But that brings me to my second comment: damn, is this expensive! We're a frugal family, and we've always done a good job of keeping our grocery bills low, but our usual groceries aren't an option now. Potatoes, rice, pasta, flour--all very cheap, and all forbidden. Acceptable foods now include meat, cheese, nuts, and specially formulated low-carb diet foods--all the pricey stuff we bought in moderation before. In the last week I've spent as much money stocking up my low-carb kitchen than I have in the last month of regular grocery shopping.</p>

<p>My third comment, though, is that I've only been doing this for a few days, and it's already having a noticeable effect--not in how I look, but how I feel. Yesterday I went to my parents' house and, purely out of habit, scooped some peanut M&amp;Ms out of their candy dish and started munching away. About halfway through my second handful, I realized what I was doing--oops! I finished the handful anyway, since putting them back would have been gross and throwing them away would have been rude. So much for yesterday's 27 gram limit.</p>

<p>About 15 minutes later, I felt the sugar hit me. I felt drained, and I started getting a light headache. Both faded after a half hour or so, but it was pretty strange--I've always had a sweet tooth, and could eat massive quantities of candy in one sitting, and I've never noticed physical effects from sugar, except maybe nausea when I ate too much. Apparently even a few days on an ultra-low carb diet can start reprogramming your body to process foods differently. It's kind of helpful, honestly. If eating sugary stuff makes me physically uncomfortable, I should have a much easier time avoiding the sweets.</p>

        <p>I guess I should have known better than to talk about my low-maintenance car and auto repair prowess; I just blew out my transmission. Thankfully, it happened about 4 miles from home, and first gear still worked, so we weren't stuck in 90+ degree heat waiting for a tow truck. Driving home at 15 mph was less than fun, but it got us there eventually.</p>

<p>Time to see if this is something I should even attempt repairing myself.</p>

        <p>I learned how to work on cars out of necessity, after buying my first one, a 20-year-old clunker that despite being garaged most of its life, had certainly not been cared for. I soon discovered that I actually enjoyed tinkering around with my engine's fiddly bits, and I resolved to remain a grease monkey forevermore.</p>

<p>Then in 2003, frustrated by my lack of a garage and lured in by easy credit, I did the unthinkable: bought a brand-new car. It was cheap and utilitarian; a Kia Spectra with a stick shift and no frills whatsoever. I have to say, this little car has been one hell of a workhorse. It has transported me without complaint for over 8 years, even when I had a trailer hitch bolted onto it and made the poor thing haul an entire apartment's worth of furniture and boxes across the Rocky Mountains to California. The only work I've ever needed done on it was an alignment readjustment after I spent a week tearing around deeply-rutted gravel roads. Oh yeah, and one brake job. Not bad at all for over 100,000 miles.</p>

<p>So when it started dripping oil in non-trivial quantities, I was a little sad, but also kind of excited. After eight years, here I was, with a fixable problem, and tools and space to work. I was back, baby!</p>

<p>I performed some exploratory surgery, did some extensive research online (YouTube will be the Haynes manual of this generation, I suppose), and ordered some parts. In one afternoon, I replaced the valve cover gasket, spark plugs, and air filter, and gave the old girl her first at-home oil change. This was by far the most satisfying bit of auto repair I've ever done. I did everything I set out to do, I never had to backtrack or undo anything I'd done, and I never got stuck and had to ask for help loosening a bolt or holding something up while I screwed it on. And when I was done, my little Kia was running better than it had in ages--plus, the awful gasoline smell it had been radiating when the engine was cold had disappeared. (Really, I should have replaced the spark plugs a loooong time ago.)</p>

<p>After a couple of showers and some me-time with a nail brush, I really enjoyed basking in my victory. I have to admit, I'm kind of looking forward to the next repair I have to do.</p>

        <p>So I'm 30 years old now, and I'm not exactly sure how I feel about that. I'm swimming in a sea of nostalgia peppered with regret, but that's sort of an average Monday for me.</p>

<p>I've been rewatching Avatar: The Last Airbender, and I finished up the series tonight. Even at 30, there are scenes in that show that make me clap and squeal with delight like an over-excited 13-year-old. The writing really is fantastic, and it's all the more impressive when you realize they did it within the constraints of a kids' show on Nickelodeon. Sure, some of the symbolism and conflicts are about as subtle as a brick to the face (<em>cough</em>Zuko<em>cough</em>), but the characters were developed enough and their struggles were real enough that I was tearing up at several points, even on a second watching.</p>

<p>It's time like this that I miss LiveJournal. Watching a really good movie or TV series always leaves me hungry for more, so I generally turn to fanfiction. Back when I used LJ extensively, my friends list was about half comprised of very talented fan writers and artists, and I usually discovered new fandoms because of them. It was a great setup, because as soon as I finished a spectacular series, I'd already have a stockpile of fanfiction to devour. These days I'm forced to turn to Google searches, which can occasionally turn up insightful, in-character, well-plotted stories, but mostly I just find idiotic "drabbles" (does anyone actually know what a drabble is anymore?) or surprise small-penis-fetish smut.</p>

<p>I'd rant about people sticking their fetishes in my fandom, but coming from a semi-reformed yaoi fangirl, it'd be a little hypocritical. (I say semi-reformed because I still enjoy the boy-on-boy romance, but I'm far more picky these days about it being in character...and usually it's not.) Anyway, if something creeps me out, I can always stop reading.</p>

<p>But back to LiveJournal. I really miss that sense of...not quite community, but connectedness that LJ had. In the early, early days, they had a "search by interest" feature that would show you the LJ users with the most shared interests with you. I found a lot of awesome people that way, and later when they turned it off, I expanded my network by checking out friends of friends. I'm not sure how to go about finding awesome people now. Technically, I could do it in a similar way, but blog-hopping is a little harder, and lacks that initial pool of like-minded people to draw from.</p>

<p>I'm reluctant to go back, because I feel like the site has really gone downhill, and most of the people I used to follow have left, so I'd have to start over again anyway. But maybe I will anyway, if only to find myself some decent fanfiction.</p>

        <p>We've had out-of-town guests for the last couple of weeks--first friends, then family--so I haven't had much time or energy for blogging. Mostly energy, really; I played quite a bit of tower defense, because it's fairly mindless and non-stressing.</p>

<p>I've also fallen behind on Couch to 5k, but I did manage to get a couple of workouts in. I've been staying on week 3, because I haven't quite felt ready to move on. The 3 minute running segments are fairly torturous toward the end, and I want to make sure I don't go too fast and make myself hate running. Strangely enough, I'm kind of enjoying it so far.</p>

<p>I've moved from running on a treadmill to running outside, which has a few difficulties. Hills are one, obviously. Part of the reason that the 3 minute segments are so difficult is that they fall  perfectly on the uphill stretches of the road. Another difficulty is rocks; I adore my Vibram 5 Fingers, but while they are fantastic for everyday wear, the soles are too thin to protect me when my foot lands directly on a pebble.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-LKyRzox63CY/TgzF7hw78LI/AAAAAAAAAG4/KRIUuKHxenw/w500/047.JPG" /><br/>
Vibrams! They look silly, but I love 'em.</p>

A sales associate at REI called this The Vibram Tan.</p>

<p>There are a few gravelly segments of my run where I keep my head down and hop/dance my way through the rocks. I'd like to get one of the styles specifically designed for outdoor running (with much thicker soles), but it took enough effort to convince myself I could spend that much on a pair of shoes once--it'll be a while before I can manage it again.</p>

<p>I tried out for a rock band yesterday. Not sure how that turned out; I'll find out in a couple days, I guess. I felt great about some parts of the audition, and awful about others...so pretty typical, really. I'm pretty excited about the band, though--they really seem to have their act together, and even if I don't get in, I think I'm going to be keeping an eye on them. If they find the right singer, they could really go places.</p>

        <p>I saw a bottle of shampoo in the store today that claimed, "Shampoo should clean your hair. A really good shampoo should leave you tingling from head to toe."</p>

<p>Er...if my shampoo left me tingling from head to toe, my first thought wouldn't be that it's a really good shampoo. My first thought would be that I might want to seek medical attention, because I could be having a catastrophic allergic reaction.</p>

        <p>After a session with my therapist, I usually feel like shopping. It's as though the emotional purge leaves me empty and ready to add more stuff to my life. I just had to convince myself not to buy a rug for my daughter's room because, although it was adorable, it would have required a redecorating of the whole room to put it in there.</p>

<p>And besides, her room is carpeted. It sure was cute, though.</p>

<p>Tuesday is also the day for my singing lesson. I've been taking lessons for around six months, after a lifetime of believing I was tone-deaf and hopeless. As it turns out, I'm not that bad. I haven't been practicing enough lately, though. It's hard to get motivated when practice means 40 minutes of the same five exercises I've been doing since I started. I <strong>am</strong> getting better, and the exercises are still valuable to me, but...well, I'm bored. My teacher says I'll be moving on to new stuff very soon--in the next week or two--but it's really been like pulling teeth to get myself to practice the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>There's another reason, too. In two weeks I'll be 30. It's hard to find the motivation to work on this when I know that there are so many people out there that are so many years ahead of me. Let's say that I stick with this for 10 years, and build my voice up to a point where I could sing professionally--how many hard rock bands do you think will want a 40-year-old woman for a lead singer? Do I adjust my dream (Join an 80s cover band? Learn guitar and be a folk musician? Matronly roles in musical theatre?), or do I soldier on in the hopes that I can be the quirky, punky rock star I see in my head? Or rather, a 20-years-older version of her?</p>

<p>Don't mind me, I'm just having a completely typical pre-turning-30 existential crisis. Maybe I'll go buy another motorcycle.</p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial, Georgia, sans-serif; line-height: 25px;">Some corporations have been accused of having a "glass ceiling," an invisible barrier that prevents women and minorities from rising to the topmost positions. In that sense, American politics clearly has a "stained-glass ceiling," a de facto barrier to atheists running for office. Despite the many great Americans who've been nonbelievers, despite the guarantees of secularism written into our Constitution, outspoken atheism is still seen as an insurmountable liability for anyone who seeks to serve our country as an elected officer of the government.</span></blockquote>


<p>True story: once, a co-worker was shocked to hear I was an atheist. "But...you're so nice to people!" she said. "And you take such good care of your cats!" It astounds me how many people think that atheism renders a person incapable of being honest, kind, responsible, or empathetic.</p>

<p>I can't wait for the day that a political candidate is accused of being an atheist, and responds with "Yeah, so what?" <strong>And still gets elected.</strong></p>
