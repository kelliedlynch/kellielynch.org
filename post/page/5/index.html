        <p>A year and 2 weeks since my last post? Whoops.</p>

<p>So I may have dropped the ball a little bit there. Good thing I didn't have any readers anyway.</p>

        <p>So...I've been utterly <strong>sucking</strong> at the whole "one thing at a time" plan. But at least I've been sucking in a way that earns me money!</p>

<p>I've discovered the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/alchemy/">Alchemy</a> boards on Etsy, and have become a wee bit obsessed. I completed my <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_transaction.php?transaction_id=24640545">first custom project</a> the other day, and have three more underway. I'm not entirely convinced it's more efficient than just making things and putting them up for sale, but it's definitely nice to have a buyer lined up for something before I even start working on it. I've put a lot of time into writing bids, sketching out ideas, and even designing and making sample items for potential customers that ended up rejecting my bid, but I'm finding it's not entirely wasted time. I'm getting a lot of benefits out of it: learning what sorts of things people actually want to buy, getting inspiration for new items to make for my shop, and getting practice estimating the amount of time a given project will take (something I've always been horrible at). And when my bids <strong>are</strong> accepted, the elation makes it all worthwhile. Seriously, I do a little victory dance every time.</p>

<p>Between the samples I've made and the 5-image limit on items I sell on Etsy, I'm finding I need another way to show off the things I've made. I feel a little lame telling people, "I don't have anything like this in my store, but I can totally do it!" Rather than a simple image gallery, I think I'll just start posting things to this blog--that way I can add a paragraph or two to explain more about the stuff when needed. (Also, it's more content for those times when I don't have much to say for three weeks at a time....<em>cough cough</em>)</p>

<p>While I've been ablaze in a crafting fury, my kid has been getting frighteningly close to walking. Also, dangerously close to ninjaing all the lewts.</p>

        <p><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/help_haiti/">help_haiti</a> is a LiveJournal community where people offer up items for auction to help relief efforts for the Haiti earthquake. Bids are placed in comments, and the high bidder makes a donation of that amount to any one of <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/help_haiti/660.html">these listed charities</a>. Once the donation is verified, the "seller" sends out the item.</p>

<p>I thought the idea was quite clever, so I'm offering up <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/help_haiti/2138.html?thread=3596378#t3596378">one custom-made Kindle case</a>. The winner will choose what colors and materials I use, what type of closure it has, and give me some idea of the style they're looking for, and I'll see what I can whip up!</p>

<p>This might be a good time for me to prune some of my bookshelves, too...</p>

    <div class="entry-content">
    
        <p>I don't generally do New Year's resolutions--why can we only improve ourselves once a year? But really, the new year is a great time for reflection, and a natural time to want to make some changes from the way things went last year.</p>

<p>My resolution for this year can be summed up in one word: Focus.</p>

<p>A couple years ago I was introduced to the concept of having multiple passive income streams--rather than getting all your money from one source (a 9-to-5 job, for instance), diversify. Find many separate ways to earn just a little bit of money with little to no ongoing work.Â  Build up enough of these income streams, and you'll have enough money to pay the bills, and enough time to work on what you really love.</p>

<p>This relatively simple advice completely changed the way I thought about work and money. I'm a natural multitasker--I'm never happy working on just one project at a time, so this seemed like a perfect approach to me. It was only in the last couple of months, though, that I've started making a serious effort to implement this advice in my life.</p>

<p>So far I haven't been terribly successful. I've been doing a lot of work and seeing little to no income. I've felt pretty discouraged at times, because I have a million and one projects I want to work on, and I can't see how I'll ever have enough time to even try them all, let alone make a decent income from them.</p>

<p>Recently I stumbled across <a href="http://entrepreneurs.about.com/cs/lifebalance/a/livingparadox_2.htm">this article</a>, and the piece I've been missing clicked into place. It's so simple, it's absurd I didn't think of it on my own, but I guess sometimes you just need someone to beat you over the head with the obvious:</p>

<blockquote>**There is absolutely no sense in spending a few hours a week on each of several projects keeping them all inching forward little by little. The trick to both finding focus and making multiple streams of income is to work on one thing at a time, and work on it until it is at the next plateau. If a project is first starting out, do whatever it takes to get it to the point that it has a life of its own. That may mean just getting it to the point that you can share it with potential collaborators or customers, or it may mean getting it to the point that it can start to generate income. Once a project has started earning revenue, let it work for you passively while you work on something else.**</blockquote>


<p>What I've been doing is total multitasking--working on everything at once, and finishing nothing to my satisfaction. It's no surprise I'm not seeing any income yet. What I need to do instead is work on one thing at a time, still juggling multiple projects, but sticking with each one long enough that it won't suffer from my absence.</p>

<p>Take <a href="http://kellielynch.etsy.com">my Etsy store</a> for example. I started off with recycled yarn, got a few skeins listed, and then discovered my huge box of crafting supplies. I decided I should sell off some of the crafting supplies to boost my sales and feedback on Etsy, so I got to work on that. Then I got into making baby clothes out of recycled thrift store stuff, mostly finished an outfit, and abandoned it to work on the Kindle cases. Despite spending hours unraveling sweaters, sorting and photographing supplies, and sewing tiny clothes, I have a box full of items that aren't earning me any money, because they aren't even listed on Etsy. Meanwhile I spent most of last night doing research for <strong>yet another</strong> new product I'd like to make.</p>

<p>That's just my Etsy store. My life is full of these little projects; I'm always trying to work on them all at once and then wondering why they're not going anywhere.</p>

<p>So, how to achieve focus? Well, here's where I guess I need to make the individual resolutions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reread <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kellielynchor-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0142000280">Getting Things Done.</a> The GTD system is fantastic, and I fell completely off it. I'm honestly not 100% sure it'll work for me anymore, as my workflow for creative and crafty projects is fairly freeform, and I have a hard time imagining breaking, say, the making of a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=38057781">Kindle case</a> into discrete steps. But if nothing else, the book is full of you-can-do-it pep talks that could help me out on this resolution thing.</li>
<li>Get all the various project ideas out of my head and onto paper. This is related to the whole GTD thing--I need to get them written down so I can stop devoting brainpower to remembering them and start devoting it to realizing them. More importantly, though, I need to classify each one as a <em>money-maker</em> (this will actively make me money), a <em>traffic-builder</em> (this will send traffic to my money-makers), or a <em>hobby</em> (I'm just doing it for fun).</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize.</strong> At any given time, my primary project--what I'm spending the largest chunk of my time and brainpower on--should be a money-maker. Traffic-builders are valuable, but they're useless without money-makers. This week, I've spent entirely too much time <a href="http://musicxchange.deviantart.com/">futzing around on deviantART</a> because it's a traffic-builder, and not nearly enough time on unraveling sweaters and making Kindle cases.</li>
<li>Cut down on the multi-tasking. Stick to the GTD philosophy of taking things one step at a time, and incorporate the above advice of taking each project to the next plateau before moving on. Just for starters, I can finish listing all my yarn and supplies <em>before</em> unraveling any more sweaters. And finish unraveling all my sweaters <em>before</em> starting any new Kindle cases. And finish listing all the yarn from <em>those</em> sweaters before working on any new projects.</li>
<li>Bake more bread. Homemade bread is yummy!</li>
</ul>


<p>And that's it--while I have a million and one different projects to work on, as long as I stick to this basic framework, I should be able to manage them, and start turning them into genuine income streams.</p>

        <p>The last couple of weeks have been the true test of whether moving back to St. Louis was really a good idea. I grew up in the Midwest, dreaming about Southern California sunshine, and finally escaped there in 2003. David and I spent 6 years out there before deciding that we missed clean air and cheap rent. Here's the view from my balcony last January:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2010/01/balcony-view-in-January-300x225.jpg" /></p>

<p>And here's the view out my back door right now:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2010/01/017-300x200.jpg" /></p>

<p>We had quite a bit of snow fall last night; the roads are awful, and I'm very glad I don't have to go anywhere today.</p>

<p>I actually don't mind the cold so much, as long as I have somewhere warm to snuggle up, but the problem is we've moved into an old brick-and-plaster house with hardwood floors and no insulation between us and the basement. We leach heat like a paper bag, and I've been taking a lot of hot showers and baths just to warm myself up.</p>

<p>The other day my feet were ice-cold despite being bundled in 2 pairs of the thickest socks I owned, and David suggested I get some slippers. I didn't think it would make much difference, since my entire body was miserably cold, but I figured it couldn't hurt. I got a big old pair of men's slippers with a plush furry lining, and let me tell you, they are stylin'.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2010/01/016-300x200.jpg" /></p>

<p>Oh yeah, I'm hip.</p>

<p>I can't believe the difference they made! Just by putting on slippers, my whole body warms up--I guess I was losing a lot of heat to the cold floor. Ridiculous furry slippers have just become one of my must-have items for general winter well-being and happiness.</p>

        <p>I don't have a one-track mind, I have a side-track mind.</p>

<p>Nearly two years after starting, I finally finished watching Avatar: the Last Airbender, and got bitten by the cosplay bug like I haven't been bitten in years. I went out and bought a bunch of leather with the intention of making the most awesome <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Azula">Azula</a> costume the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>I'd cut out the leather for one boot and stitched two pieces of it together, when I noticed my husband looking at cases for his new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&tag=kellielynchor-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0015T963C">Kindle</a>. I'd just spent the afternoon rearranging my craft supplies, and a light bulb went on in my head. I had a couple of old hardcover books I'd picked up at the thrift store, but never figured out what to do with them. Hmm, cut cover off book, add leather--<strong>voila!</strong> New product for my Etsy store!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=37802796"><img src="/uploads/2010/01/kindle001_5.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>So my boots are all but forgotten for the moment, but I've got another case half-finished on my sewing table, and a stack of old books to destroy. Life is good.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/41800/">Gratuitous Space Battles</a> is sort of like a tower defense game, except you get to design the towers. You build your fleet of ships from an array of modular components, give your units orders that determine their behavior, then sit back and watch the fireworks. The game is almost a little <strong>too</strong> complex, especially when you first pick it up--there's no slowly ramping-up series of introductory missions designed to familiarize you with each weapon in your arsenal, just pages and pages of little parts like Lego pieces with numbers attached. But after fiddling with it for a while, I started getting the basics worked out and decimating the opposing fleets in gorgeous technicolor laser displays. My only real complaint about the game is that you end up doing quite a bit of trial and error, throwing fleet after fleet of meticulously designed ships at your opponent until you hit the right balance to win. Still, it's fun, and I've certainly gotten my $10 worth over the last couple of days.</p>

In the future, all the cool kids will do battle with sharpened antler-guns with training wheels on them.</p>

<p>In other gaming news, I've been trying and failing to summon any sort of enthusiasm for Final Fantasy XIII. <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/12/final-fantasy-xiii-preview-2/">This review</a> in <strong>Wired</strong> leaves me wanting to run for the hills, while <a href="http://kotaku.com/5433455/final-fantasy-xiii-impressions-15-years-later-25-hours-in">this review</a> on Kotaku basically says everything the Wired review does and adds, "But it's fun anyway!" While I love looking at beautiful androgynous teenagers as much as the next lecherous old woman, the last few installments of this series have left me feeling fairly flat. The last time I really <em>cared</em> about a character in a Final Fantasy game was a long, long time ago, before I even knew that they had a different numbering system in Japan.</p>

        <p>Our Christmas gift to ourselves was a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=17316">Canon EOS Rebel XS</a>--a nice entry-level digital SLR. David and I are both somewhat interested in photography, but have never had a nice enough camera to do much. I really don't know anything about the art of photography, so at the moment I'm just overcome with glee at how quickly this thing snaps photos, and how wonderfully crisp the images are, even with poor lighting.</p>

<p>Now that I have a halfway-decent camera, I'm thinking about selling stock photography. There are a ton of web sites out there where you can upload photos for sale, and it would be a nice little passive income stream--once I upload the photos, I won't really have to think about them. Of course, this means I have to learn to be a halfway-decent photographer, too. Expect a lot of photos of my kid and my cats while I learn how to use this thing.</p>
