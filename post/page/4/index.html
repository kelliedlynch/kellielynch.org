        <p>Lately I've been toying with the idea of getting rid of my desktop computer. Why take up that much space and power (I tend to leave it running so I can surf reddit at a moment's notice) when I have a laptop and a smartphone that do everything I bother to use it for? (Though the smartphone hasn't been that great lately--I found the ROM I was using to be too buggy and switched back to aospCMod, rendering <a href="/2011/06/03/paused/">my awesome keyboard</a> useless until one of the devs decides they want to make Bluetooth work properly.)</p>

<p>A few days ago I transferred all my important files onto my laptop and packed the desktop away. I got sidetracked by extensive yard work after that, so my desk never got cleared off. The result is that I haven't really been online (or opened the laptop) in a while.</p>

<p>I did get my poor abused lawn replanted, though. My flower beds are still far from finished. I wish I'd taken some "before" pictures of all this. I have no doubt the change will be impressive, but I never remember these things until I'm half done tearing things down.</p>

<p>When we moved in, there were two tiers of flower beds next to the house that were bordered with old railroad ties. The beds were totally overrun with weeds, and when I went in to weed them (a couple hours worth of work, I was sure) I discovered the ties were half-rotted and <strong>completely</strong> full of termites. I figured having delicious termite snacks that close to the house was just asking for trouble, so I dug them out and started re-defining the edges with brick. We have a number of crumbling brick retaining walls on the property, as well as a dilapidated brick firepit, so there was no shortage of material.</p>

<p><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-7BOqt3B7IOk/TefhAKpmx7I/AAAAAAAAAGc/h44kRoLmg0g/w500/IMG_20110530_165402.jpg"/><br/>
I did all this WITH MY BARE HANDS! RAWR!</p>

<p>The first tier of the flower bed is now about 80% done--I'm not about to run off for a lucrative career as a bricklayer anytime soon, but the mortar joints are smooth and straight, more or less. Again, I wish I had a before picture of the flower beds, but  here's what they looked like after I'd started stacking the brick in place to see how much I'd need.</p>

Left Side</p>

<p>Gardening is strangely satisfying. I'm one of those people who kills every houseplant that passes through their door, but I planted a couple trays of seeds a few weeks ago, and most of them have been sprouting happily. I love seeing whole trays of green things I haven't managed to kill yet. Now if I can manage to replant them all in the flower beds without killing them, I'll be a happy camper.</p>

        <p>True story: a week ago, I was planning to write a letter to Anthony Weiner, asking for his advice. I've been politically apathetic most of my life, and Rep. Wiener was the first liberal politician who made me feel like it might be worth getting involved. For the first time, I thought maybe you <strong>could</strong> be witty, straight-talking, and passionate about things and still be in politics. For the first time, I felt like I might be able to contribute, and might be able to help other jaded young liberals overcome their apathy and fight for what they believe in. I wanted to ask this man, my new political hero, what <strong>I</strong> could do, how I could make a difference.</p>

<p>And then: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/06/anthony-weiner-twitter-new-photos_n_871817.html">scandal</a>! When Mr. Allie told me that Rep. Weiner was caught up in a media frenzy over naughty pictures, I said, "<strong>Please</strong> tell me his response was 'yeah, so what?" Because that would have been awesome, and it would have been exactly what I expected from him. "Yep, I did it. Who cares? It's not a crime, it doesn't affect my job, next question."</p>

<p>But no. Instead, he responded in the most typically weasel/politician manner possible. "I was hacked. I can't say if that's my penis. We're looking into it." Guys, quick question: if someone showed you a picture of an underwear-clad erection, would you be able to tell if it was yours? Would you perhaps recognize the underwear, or the leg in the background, or maybe, say, a part of your body that you have been intimately familiar with since puberty? No reasonable person can be expected to believe that he <strong>simply didn't know</strong> whether the photo was of him or not.</p>

<p>So when he said, "I can't say if that's a picture of me," what he clearly meant was, "That is me, but if I flat-out lie about it, I will be in way more trouble than if I act like a weasel and dodge the question."</p>

<p>Representative Weiner, shame on you. Not because you sent lewd photos to someone (I couldn't care less), and not because you were presumably doing this without your wife's consent (which I <strong>do</strong> find a little sleazy, and makes me slightly concerned about your honesty in general, but still isn't enough to completely dissolve my respect for you), but because of the way you reacted when confronted about it. When faced with possible scandal, you reacted like every other two-faced, double-talking, sleazeball politician that made me so jaded in the first place.</p>

<p>If <strong>anyone</strong> could have pulled off the straight answer and come out stronger for it, Representative Weiner, it was you. Here is how you <strong>should</strong> have responded:</p>

<p>Step 1: Sit down with your wife and apologize profusely. Tell her, "I screwed up, and I will do everything in my power to make it up to you and ensure it doesn't happen again. I understand if you're not ready to forgive me, but I ask that you please support me, at least publicly, in the media shitstorm I'm about to endure."</p>

<p>Step 2: When asked about it by the media, say, "Yes, I sent those pictures. The only person I have wronged by doing so is my wife, and I am answering to her for that. I will not say any more on the subject, because it is irrelevant. Let's get back to the issues that matter."</p>

<p>Step 3: Shut your damn mouth and get back to the issues that matter.</p>

<p>If you had responded like that, Representative Weiner, and not like every other lying weasel of a politician who gets called out on his bullshit, my respect for you would have increased tenfold. My letter to you would have been glowing with praise, and I would have defended you and your erection whenever they came up (har, har) in conversation.</p>

<p>But no. I truly feel like my hero died. I still want to get involved, but I no longer care what you think. You're just another one of them.</p>

        <p>Depression is something I've struggled with my whole life, but two years ago, I finally went into treatment for it. Medication has been keeping things mostly under control, but not entirely--I currently see a therapist once a week who has been helping a great deal as well.</p>

<p>When I first tried to get help, I reread a lot of what I'd written over the last several years, and I noticed a clear pattern--tremendous highs and lows, lasting weeks to months, flipping from one to the other almost instantly. At my first appointment with a psychiatrist, I told her I suspected I was bipolar; she dismissed my concern almost immediately. I can't remember exactly why, though I think it was related to my sleep habits. In any case, I trusted that she was more of an expert than I was and tried to push the suspicion out of my mind.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, while talking about what I'd been doing the last week, I noticed my therapist was quizzing me about textbook bipolar symptoms. To make a long story short, I'm now in the process of changing medications.</p>

<p>Right now I feel like I'm in a full-on manic state. Last week I started the <a href="http://www.c25k.com/">Couch to 5k</a> program. A couple days later, I decided to add a diet to it. Two days after that, I made the diet more extreme--animals are treated terribly in factory farms, so why not just go vegetarian? Now I'm toying with the idea of veganism--I mean, aren't dairy farms just as bad? When I'm in this state, I suffer from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep">project creep</a> in every part of my life.</p>

<p>I thought it would be good to try to write something; now I'm plotting a novel. I wanted to weed the flower beds; now I'm rebuilding them in brick, which I'm reclaiming from the destruction of a fire pit on the other side of the yard. I've been interested in linguistics for years; I saw a post by a linguist on reddit yesterday, and now I feel like moving to Germany to finally get a degree might be fun. I went to the humane society today and I'm considering adopting a super-sweet Corgi/German shepherd mix--I've got so much love to give, and a yard, so why not get a dog?</p>

<p>A hallmark of mental illness is the inability to accept logic; refusing the conclusion despite overwhelming evidence. I recognize that I'm in the middle of textbook manic behavior. I know, somewhere in my head, that I'm trying to take on a lot of stuff at once, and it's probably more than I can handle. But the larger part of my brain is saying it's not <strong>all</strong> that much. I'm doing well so far, haven't missed a workout yet. Okay, I've blown out my wrist, but that could happen to anyone, right?</p>

<p>Few people seek treatment during a manic phase, because they feel <strong>fucking fantastic.</strong> You're embarking on a thousand exciting new projects, you're accomplishing things, you feel like there's nothing you can't do. Move to Germany? Heck yeah! Family doesn't want to come along? That's okay! It's only for a couple of years, and the result is worth the sacrifice! Somehow it doesn't even seem possible that being in a strange country and separated from my husband and child might negatively impact my studies. I'll be free of distractions! Class all day, homework all night! It's so hard to explain how I can feel this way; I see exactly why it doesn't make sense, but that doesn't change anything.</p>

<p>No, I'm not moving to Germany (but Austin could work). And it's not even that it would be a terrible idea to adopt a dog. But it might be a little overwhelming, and I don't know what else to cut out.</p>

<p>Here, have a picture of the doggie.</p>

        <p>I did something to my wrist a couple days ago while doing yard work, so I've spent the last couple of days indoors, trying not to hurl anything heavy around. I don't know how I injured myself, but you'd think with the amount of pain I'm in right now, I'd remember how it started.</p>

<p>It's hard to find things to occupy yourself indoors when you've got a dozen outdoor projects in progress. I spent a day mainly watching stuff on Netflix: a couple of documentaries, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036TGSIK/?tag=allispar-20">The Easy A</a>, which turned out to be such a fantastic movie that I forced David to watch it with me again the next day.</p>

<p>I also spent a day trying to get the used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B0002OKCXE/?tag=allispar-20">iGo Stowaway</a> bluetooth keyboard I just got to play nice with my LG Optimus V. I rooted the phone a couple weeks ago in anticipation of this, and installed <a href="http://romrepo.info/wiki/index.php?title=What_is_aospCMod">aospCMod</a>, since Android 2.2, which came factory installed, does not support bluetooth keyboards for some reason. Much to my dismay, while I was able to pair the keyboard with my phone (after a great deal of fiddling), most of the punctuation on the right side of the keyboard wouldn't work. A keyboard that cant type apostrophes isnt much use to me.</p>

<p>So I switched to <a href="http://forum.androidcentral.com/optimus-v-rooting-roms-hacks/62730-zefies-cm7-optimus-v-current-03012011-a.html">Zefie's Cyanogenmod</a>, which has a few of its own input problems, but at least lets me use my new toy. I don't think it'll be a proper replacement for a laptop until a few major bugs are worked out--I keep slipping into capslock for no good reason, and some basic functions of the onscreen keyboard are borked--but I might be able to type out blog entries and such without lugging a laptop around.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-T3KPXG6FUek/Te2t527vugI/AAAAAAAAADo/Onr1q5tpNP0/s400/IMG_2591.JPG" /><br/>
Folded up, it's barely bigger than the phone.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lS2vRtjZm10/Te2uETehtLI/AAAAAAAAADs/luvtTY4JjnQ/s400/IMG_2592.JPG" /><br/>
Presto! Full size keyboard!</p>

<p>I hope to be back outside tomorrow; I'm stalled in the middle of digging up my flowerbeds, and I really want to get to putting flowers in them before the growing season is over.</p>

        <p>One of the reasons I'm blogging under a pseudonym is that David and I practice polyamory; we openly date other people. Or semi-openly, anyway. We're not exactly "out" to our families, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if they found out. My main reason for wanting anonymity is that I don't want to jeopardize my husband's career if he were to need to change jobs.</p>

<p>Even though I'm safely behind a pseudonym, though, I felt some hesitation about talking about it. When you're part of a relatively small subculture, it's hard not to feel like you're an ambassador for the subculture. Even if nobody but my friends ever read this blog, I still feel like part of the public face of polyamory. I also suffer from severe depression and a few other issues I'm sure I'll talk about later. I've always felt that public perception is that openly poly people are more likely than average to suffer from these issues. The last thing we need is more "evidence" out there that poly people are a bunch of crazies. (Charlie Sheen, anyone?)</p>

<p>Eventually I decided that to close off part of my life from discussion would defeat the entire purpose of starting this blog, and I had a realization about the "perception problem." It's not that poly people are more likely to suffer from these problems; it's that they're more likely to talk about it. It makes sense that someone who practices a lifestyle that involves frequent disclosures of feelings and activities, and frequent negotiations of relationship situations, would be more likely than average to feel okay about discussing their depression, or more likely to seek treatment for a personality disorder.</p>

<p>Mental illness is seriously stigmatized in...well, just about every culture. To defeat that stigma, we need to talk about it; we need to stop being ashamed of what's affecting us. Most people wouldn't think twice about going to their doctor if they had a physical illness--why should depression be any different? Similarly, to defeat the stigma surrounding polyamory, we need to talk about it. In both cases, I'm not talking about shouting from the treetops--I'm talking about treating it as any other aspect of your life. "That woman with my husband yesterday? Oh, that was just his girlfriend."</p>

<p>There are already several wonderful places around the internet for polyamory information and activism (such as <a href="http://www.xeromag.com/fvpoly.html">Xeromag</a>, <a href="http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/">Polyamory in the Media</a>, or <a href="http://www.polyamorousmisanthrope.com/">The Polyamorous Misanthrope</a>), and I don't really want to go down that road. But I feel like what our community (inasmuch as it can be called that) lacks is people who are "incidentally polyamorous." The pro athlete who happens to be dating several people, or the mommy-blogger who happens to live with the other two members of her triad (actually, there are a couple of "poly mom" blogs, but on the ones I've seen, "poly" is the main focus, not "mom"). There are a few people who are openly poly without being activists (<a title="The Ferrett's LiveJournal" href="http://theferrett.livejournal.com/">The Ferrett</a> springs to mind), but I suspect most of us are in the closet.</p>

<p>As an ambassador, I'll admit I'm not an ideal choice. I'm not trying to set myself up as a shining example of "poly done right," but it is a part of my life, and I feel it's important to talk about it as it comes up.</p>

        <p>I've been trying to figure out how green I really want to be. I recycle, I use compact fluorescent bulbs, and I drive a fuel-efficient car, but there's a lot more I could be doing. I just don't know if I really want to do it.</p>

<p>For the most part, I only want to take the eco-friendly option if there's a clear benefit to me. CFLs save me money in the long run, plus they eliminate the hassle of having to change burned out light bulbs. Easy peasy. But what about shopping bags? I have a number of reusable bags, but I can't for the life of me remember to toss them in the car when I'm likely to go shopping. One would think if it was really important to me, I would remember.</p>

<p>Recycling is something of an exception--it actually <em>costs</em> me money (a small charge tacked onto the monthly trash bill), and forces me to keep an extra trash can in the house. And yet I do it; I suppose I've successfully internalized that letting my cans, bottles, and cardboard boxes clog up landfills is a Bad Thing. Perhaps it would help if I read more articles about the evils of plastic shopping bags.</p>

<p>The husband and I have a long-term goal of building an eco-friendly house, though once again, mainly because of the clear benefit to us. We could get tax credits to offset the additional price of the green features, and in the long run, the savings in our utility bills could help us have a comfortable retirement. A well-insulated house is comfortable year-round, and using passive solar design would give us bright, cheerful rooms full of sun. What's not to love? I wouldn't mind installing a dual-flush toilet to save water, but I draw the line at low-flow shower heads or giving up soaks in the tub. Bathing, for me, is time to luxuriate.</p>

<p>I want to do more, but almost purely for the feeling of self-satisfaction I get from it, not because I have a clear image in my head of the impact my actions have on the world. I care about the environment, but lowering my carbon footprint isn't that high on my list of priorities. What can you do to save the environment when you don't <em>really</em> care?</p>

<p>Obviously, I can start with the shopping bags.</p>

        <p>Thunderstorms knocked out our internet today, so I'm giving posting from my phone a shot. Typing is a bit slow, but otherwise things seem to be going smoothly. We really are living in the future.</p>

<p>It's a cicada year, apparently, and so far all I know about cicadas is that they give me the willies. Okay, they're harmless, but watching these little buggers literally crawl out of their skin is just gross.</p>

One of these days, one of these guys will land on my face, and I will break my own nose trying to kill it.</p>

<p>I spent most of the day destroying things--I sprayed herbicide on all the weeds in the yard, and did a bunch of demolition in the carport. A previous owner of this house built some largely useless storage out there (very wide closets accessible only by a narrow door), and I'm badly in need of space for a workbench and tool storage. The closets are built out of nice wide tongue and groove cedar planks, which sadly were then painted. I hate when people paint cedar; it's such a lovely wood. Now I need to figure out what, if anything, I want to do with a bunch of reclaimed painted cedar planks.</p>

<p>The carport, while not really any more attractive, is certainly quite a bit more functional. Attractiveness will come later...I hope.</p>

Not really a before picture--just the storage area I haven&#39;t demolished for comparison.</p>

After! Still needs a lot of work, but at least I can reach it all now.</p>

        <p>So, here I go again.</p>

<p>I've wanted to start a blog for some time now. Years ago I had a LiveJournal, but as their policy changes got more and more draconian, my friends started drifting away from the site to other corners of the internet, and in time so did I. Rather than entrust my personal data and memories to another online service, I figured I might as well start my own blog.</p>

<p>I had a few attempts that never got anywhere. First I tried blogging about really specific topics, but I ran out of things to say. Then I switched to a more LiveJournal-type personal blog, but that didn't work out because it was attached to my real name. I felt like there were a lot of things I couldn't say there--if it were just me, I wouldn't care that much if Grandma stumbled across the sordid details of my life, but for the sake of the rest of my family, I'd rather certain things didn't show up when one casually Googles my name. Eventually I stopped writing in that blog because even <em>I</em> was getting bored with that watered-down and ultra-filtered version of my real life.</p>

<p>I've never been a big fan of pseudonyms, but I'm hoping this will work out a little better. With any luck, I'll be able to stay interested this time.</p>

    <div class="entry-content">
    
        <p>I've been hurling myself headlong into some new pursuits, as I often do. After a lifetime of saying "I wish I could be a musician," I've finally started taking singing lessons and teaching myself to play the guitar.</p>

<p>I recently read <a href="http://nymag.com/print/?/news/features/27840/">this article</a> in New York Magazine about the effects of praise on children, and the subject matter hit a bit close to home...and as the parent of a young child, I was hit especially hard. The article's focus is how the <strong>wrong kind</strong> of praise can impact a child's willingness to learn new things. It can be especially harmful to praise a child by saying they're smart, rather than praising hard work and specific achievements.</p>

<blockquote>I am smart, the kids' reasoning goes; I don't need to put out effort. Expending effort becomes stigmatized--it's public proof that you can't cut it on your natural gifts.</blockquote>


<p>As a former "gifted child," I can attest to the accuracy of this. In elementary school, I always ended up at the head of the class without any effort, and was praised often on how "smart" I was. If something was hard work, it wasn't worth doing: <strong>anyone</strong> can get good at something with hard work; it takes genius to do it with nothing but natural awesomeness.</p>

<p>So despite spending my whole life wishing I could be a musician, I never actually chased that goal. Why?</p>

<p>Reason One: Starting in 5th grade, we were allowed to start playing instruments. I picked the flute, and continued playing it for 5 years. I rarely practiced outside class; in fact, my last year playing, I never even took my flute home. As would be expected (by anyone but me), I wasn't very good at it, and usually sat at the back of the section. Clearly I wasn't cut out to be a flute player.</p>

<p>Reason Two: Tenth grade. Once again, I tried out for a musical: The Sound of Music. During the singing audition, I was handed the sheet music for "Climb Every Mountain," a song I'd never heard before. I started singing, and the choir director immediately stopped me. "You're in the wrong key," he said, hammering on a piano key. "You start here." I tried again. Again he stopped me. "Why are you singing way down there?" Again the piano. "Here. <em>Climb...cliiiimb.</em>" After a few more tries, he gave up and dismissed me. Clearly I would never be a singer.</p>

<p>Reason Three: Age 15. I decided to give my mom's electric guitar a try. I tried a few chords, and felt totally overwhelmed. The finger positions seemed completely nonsensical and unrelated to anything; my fingers were too fat and kept holding down strings they weren't supposed to; and even when they didn't, I didn't know what it was supposed to sound like, so I couldn't tell if I'd played it right. I put the guitar away and never tried again. Clearly I would never be a guitar player.</p>

<p>So I spent most of my life thinking I had no musical talent and would be hopeless forever. Then, thanks to playing a lot of Rock Band, I started to suspect otherwise. I started doing vocals on easy, then I moved up to medium, hard, and finally expert. If I could pass the songs on expert, then I must be at least <em>close</em> to the right pitch, right?</p>

<p>When I went to my first singing lesson, I went through a few tests with my instructor. He tested my range, my ability to match pitches, and the clarity of my voice, and said something shocking: "You've got a good voice. I didn't notice anything seriously wrong; you've just got to develop the muscles." Encouraged, I started practicing 30 minutes every day, and then in a fit of impulsiveness, went to a pawn shop and picked up a used acoustic guitar. Imagine my surprise when I tried to play a few chords and found that my fingers weren't too fat after all; it just took a little effort to get them in the right places. So now I'm practicing that every day, too. My fingertips are sore (and maybe a little blistered), but I'm going to stick with it until I develop those badges of the guitar player's craft: thick calluses.</p>

<p>Honestly, this all seems a little simple. Shouldn't it have been obvious that if I didn't work at things, I wouldn't get good at them? But it wasn't, probably thanks to those early years of everything coming easily. (Everything I bothered to try a second time, anyway.) Despite having learned to do some difficult things since, I had myself absolutely convinced that I was permanently tone-deaf and clumsy, with defective vocal cords--why else would I have been so bad at music as a teenager?</p>

<p>If my fingertips let me practice enough, I'll be going to next Friday's open mic night at my favorite coffee shop. Who knows? Maybe I'll finally grow up to be a rock star. And when I do, I'm going to remember to tell Danielle it was hard work and not natural gifts that got me there.</p>
