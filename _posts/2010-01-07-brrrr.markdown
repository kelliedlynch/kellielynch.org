The last couple of weeks have been the true test of whether moving back to St. Louis was really a good idea. I grew up in the Midwest, dreaming about Southern California sunshine, and finally escaped there in 2003. David and I spent 6 years out there before deciding that we missed clean air and cheap rent. Here's the view from my balcony last January:

And here's the view out my back door right now:

We had quite a bit of snow fall last night; the roads are awful, and I'm very glad I don't have to go anywhere today.

I actually don't mind the cold so much, as long as I have somewhere warm to snuggle up, but the problem is we've moved into an old brick-and-plaster house with hardwood floors and no insulation between us and the basement. We leach heat like a paper bag, and I've been taking a lot of hot showers and baths just to warm myself up.

The other day my feet were ice-cold despite being bundled in 2 pairs of the thickest socks I owned, and David suggested I get some slippers. I didn't think it would make much difference, since my entire body was miserably cold, but I figured it couldn't hurt. I got a big old pair of men's slippers with a plush furry lining, and let me tell you, they are stylin'.

Oh yeah, I'm hip.

I can't believe the difference they made! Just by putting on slippers, my whole body warms up--I guess I was losing a lot of heat to the cold floor. Ridiculous furry slippers have just become one of my must-have items for general winter well-being and happiness.
