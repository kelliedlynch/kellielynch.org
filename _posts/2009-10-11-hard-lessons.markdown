Things I've learned this weekend:

1) When they say don't put your yarn in the washer,** don't put your yarn in the washer**. Seriously, not even on the delicate cycle, for the shortest time possible, with cold water. It won't end well.

2) I am not a professional carpenter.

The yarn-winding machine needs help, but I'm not sure what it needs. The wheels don't spin freely enough, and I can't figure out what to use as a belt that won't slip around on the wheels. I think I'll have to spend a while wandering thoughtfully around Lowe's.

On the plus side, the PVC niddy-noddy is working out great! I've managed to undo a little bit of the mess I made with the washing machine, and I have a couple skeins of clean, untangled yarn to sell.
