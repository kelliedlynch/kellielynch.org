Two awkward conversations later, we're now officially out as poly to both sets of parents. One went about as I expected, and the other was not at all as bad as I'd feared. It's a relief to not have to worry about being accidentally outed by my daughter. In fact, it's good we had those conversations, because just a couple days after coming out to my in-laws, she explained to them how she had gone to Steak 'n' Shake with Daddy the night before, because Mommy had gone to see B. 

Aside from that, I haven't been doing much that's terribly newsworthy. I've been playing a lot of games on the [computer][dredmor] and [iPhone][kingdom], when I'm not spending time with the assorted important people in my life.

Our house has been on the market for a bit over 3 months now, and we haven't had any encouraging news yet. I know in this market, that's not unusual. Still, it's frustrating. We decided at the beginning of the year that we wanted to move, and it's annoying to be stuck here after making that decision. Also, it's stressful to know that at any moment, we could get a showing request and have to get the place perfectly clean and rush out the door. I'm looking forward to getting back into the city, settling in, and relaxing.

Well, I think we all know that last bit isn't going to happen. Relaxation isn't really in my repertoire.
