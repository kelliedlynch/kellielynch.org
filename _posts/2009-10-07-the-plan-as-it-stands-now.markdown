Ideally, I want to be able to make a decent income while still being able to stay at home with my daughter. I've gone on a huge crafting/do-it-yourself kick lately, so I'm currently exploring crafty ways to do this.

We've recently moved to a large city with an abundance of thrift stores, and I love thrift shopping, so this seems like a good place to start. I've got an enormous list of projects to try out, most of them involving recycling or reusing old items. A trip to a local store turned up a couple of lovely gently-used sweaters, so I'm going to give recycling yarn a try.

I've got a sage green 100% silk sweater, and a candy pink 100% cashmere sweater to start with. Both feel lovely and are in good shape. I've managed to take the silk one apart a bit, and I now have quite a lot of 4-ply lace weight yarn. Once I get the whole thing unraveled, I'll need to skein it, wash it, and put it up for sale on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>.

Also on my to-do list: thinking up a good name for my Etsy store. I'll need something generic enough to cover the myriad ridiculous little craft projects I'll no doubt be embarking on. Sadly, "Whatever" is already taken.
