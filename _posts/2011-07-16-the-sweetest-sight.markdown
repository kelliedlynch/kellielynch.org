My husband is off on a week-and-a-half business trip, leaving me alone with our daughter for the longest I've ever been. It's only day two, and I'm unable to fathom how single parents do this for **years. **I love the little rugrat dearly, but sometimes this sight is the most beautiful thing in the world:

She doesn't take a nap every day anymore, which makes times like this even more precious. Silence reigns, I can focus on projects for more than 5 minutes at a time, and I might even have time for a 10-minute catnap myself, as soon as I stop writing this blog entry.

So long.
