So it's a month later, and I finally have <a href="http://kellielynch.etsy.com">an Etsy store</a>. Good thing nobody's actually reading this blog yet.

I have a really annoying tendency to think I'm Superwoman and take on too many projects at once. If I could learn how to accurately estimate my own capabilities, I would have a much easier time with...well, pretty much everything.
