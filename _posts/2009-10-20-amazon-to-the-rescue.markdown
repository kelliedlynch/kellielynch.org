I gave up on my yarn-winding machine last night and ordered a ball winder on Amazon. I'm fairly sure I can make a working swift from scrap wood, but my life would be made much easier by having a winder that works without any fiddling or tinkering.

Now if only Amazon sold names--I still need one for my Etsy store.
