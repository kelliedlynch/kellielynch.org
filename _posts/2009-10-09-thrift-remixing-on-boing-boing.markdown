Ah, relevance! There's a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/10/09/junky-styling-a-manu.html">post on Boing Boing</a> about Junky Styling: Wardrobe Surgery, a new book from the founders of <a href="http://www.junkystyling.co.uk/">Junky Styling</a>.

Some of their stuff is really inspiring. I love this trench coat dress:

Other items...are less inspiring:

Points for originality, I suppose, but I'll take a pass on wearing it.
