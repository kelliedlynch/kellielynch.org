I couldn't decide what to do for my next craft project, but then I discovered a wonderful store called <a href="http://www.gatewaycatalog.com/">Gateway Electronics</a>. I bought a bunch of interesting-looking electronic parts that were just <em>begging</em> to become part of a steampunk ray gun.

Then I got the parts home, and realized the ray gun would have to wait.

One of the first home improvement projects I wanted to do in this house was to convert the closet in the third bedroom (which we use as an office) into a fold-away craft center. I could craft to my heart's content, and then close up the doors when I wasn't using it.

I used some used oak flooring to build a tabletop into the closet, moved the shelf up, and took out the clothes bar. After that, I couldn't decide what I wanted the rest of it to look like--I figured I'd get a better idea of what storage I needed after I used it a while.

Problem is, it took almost no time for it to look like this:

So this week's project is to do something about that. Just cleaning it won't do--without any decent storage in there, it'll just return to its current state. It's time to roll up my sleeves, buy some lumber, and build <em>the best damn craft center in the country</em>. Or at least the best one that can fit in my closet.

Since this project is a bit more ambitious than a ray gun, I'm going to give myself two weeks. Aaaaaaaand...go!
