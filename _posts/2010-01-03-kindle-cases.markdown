I don't have a one-track mind, I have a side-track mind.

Nearly two years after starting, I finally finished watching Avatar: the Last Airbender, and got bitten by the cosplay bug like I haven't been bitten in years. I went out and bought a bunch of leather with the intention of making the most awesome <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Azula">Azula</a> costume the world has ever seen.

I'd cut out the leather for one boot and stitched two pieces of it together, when I noticed my husband looking at cases for his new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&tag=kellielynchor-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0015T963C">Kindle</a>. I'd just spent the afternoon rearranging my craft supplies, and a light bulb went on in my head. I had a couple of old hardcover books I'd picked up at the thrift store, but never figured out what to do with them. Hmm, cut cover off book, add leather--**voila!** New product for my Etsy store!

So my boots are all but forgotten for the moment, but I've got another case half-finished on my sewing table, and a stack of old books to destroy. Life is good.
