So, here I go again.

I've wanted to start a blog for some time now. Years ago I had a LiveJournal, but as their policy changes got more and more draconian, my friends started drifting away from the site to other corners of the internet, and in time so did I. Rather than entrust my personal data and memories to another online service, I figured I might as well start my own blog.

I had a few attempts that never got anywhere. First I tried blogging about really specific topics, but I ran out of things to say. Then I switched to a more LiveJournal-type personal blog, but that didn't work out because it was attached to my real name. I felt like there were a lot of things I couldn't say there--if it were just me, I wouldn't care that much if Grandma stumbled across the sordid details of my life, but for the sake of the rest of my family, I'd rather certain things didn't show up when one casually Googles my name. Eventually I stopped writing in that blog because even *I* was getting bored with that watered-down and ultra-filtered version of my real life.

I've never been a big fan of pseudonyms, but I'm hoping this will work out a little better. With any luck, I'll be able to stay interested this time.
