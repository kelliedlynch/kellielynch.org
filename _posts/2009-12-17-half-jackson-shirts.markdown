Here's another project I've been working on in my spare time (ha!).

The concept is a t-shirt store that works on a pre-order basis. Every week, I post 1 to 3 new t-shirt designs, with an ordering deadline. If enough pre-orders come in, the shirt is printed and shipped out, and if not, all the orders are refunded (with an option to pick a different shirt instead, of course). Buyers get a truly limited-edition shirt (since each one only has one print run), and because I don't have to pay to have the shirts printed ahead of time, I can keep the per-shirt cost as low as possible. The plan is to offer all the shirts at $10 each.

I'm calling it Half Jackson, because Andrew Jackson is on the $20 bill, and all the shirts are....half a Jackson. Get it? Eh? Eh? Ah, I slay me.

So anyway, my good friend <a href="http://www.horizonscape.com/delphinity">Christina</a> is doing the design work for me. She sent me some logo ideas a while ago, and I finally got around to reviewing them today. I'm absolutely loving this one:

I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, but I could totally see that guy as a youngish, hipster Andrew Jackson. It makes me giggle.

We've still got to do a little back-and-forth on revisions, and I've got a lot of CSS wrangling ahead of me, but I'm hopeful that I'll be able to launch the web site in a month or so. Which probably means I'll actually do it next July.
