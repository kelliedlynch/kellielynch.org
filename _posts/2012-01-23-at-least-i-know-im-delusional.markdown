So about 3 months or so ago, I bought a drafting table. I'd wanted one for a long time, and hey, maybe if I got one, I'd be inspired to draw more. About an hour after I put it together, I'd already started putting junk on it, and it was quickly buried.

I finally cleared it off the other day, and wisely left the top in the inclined position, so I can't leave more junk on it.
