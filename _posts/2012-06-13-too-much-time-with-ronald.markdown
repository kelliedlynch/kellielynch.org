Two weeks without my husband has made me a connoisseur of McDonald's restaurants--specifically, the ones with kids' play areas. When I'm dealing with a rambunctious 3-year-old by myself all day, places where I can turn my child loose, put my feet up, and enjoy free wifi for an hour or two are pure paradise.

The House Springs location is closest to home, but they keep their A/C turned a little lower than I prefer. Valley Park is a good balance between drive time and quality of playground. Kirkwood has hands-down the best playground and a very accessible bathroom, but it's a bit of a drive, and they play children's music that can get stuck in your head for the rest of the day--I'll only risk it if I'm feeling gutsy or lucky. Des Peres is a good location, from what I can remember, but if you get within a mile of the place, Danielle immediately recognizes that Chick-fil-A is near and starts demanding that instead. I can't remember what the Manchester location is like; maybe I'll head that way tomorrow if I'm feeling adventurous.

Yeah, I kind of hate myself.

I've been spending my ill-gotten time well, though. For a long time I've been wanting to get myself back up to speed on PHP but not actually doing it; getting away from the distractions of home has been immensely helpful, and the environment works well for the short bursts of intense concentration I need. I'm starting to feel proficient again, and I'm building things. It's a good feeling. And it's left me feeling more motivated at home, too. I've been cooking and canning and preserving, and yesterday I baked a cake. It was delicious.

Still, I really look forward to David getting back from his business trip this weekend. Productivity is nice and all, but my husband is nicer.
