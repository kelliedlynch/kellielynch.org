A few years ago I started collecting absurd classified ads. I had plans for a website, but it turned out I couldn't find enough of them to post several times a week. I figured I might as well post them here.

How does one go about buying used vibrators, anyway? Do you get to do a test drive? Oh well, I wanted to get some paintings anyway--might as well kill two birds with one stone.

What I loved best about this ad was that it ran again a couple weeks later, this time without the miscellaneous household goods. Hope springs eternal.
