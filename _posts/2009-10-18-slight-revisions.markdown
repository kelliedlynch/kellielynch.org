I had originally planned to get my Etsy store up and running this week, but between destroying half my yarn in the washing machine and getting knocked out by the flu, I think this week will be spent playing catch-up. Here's what I need to do:

	* Think of a name for the store.
	* Finish unwinding at least 1 skein from each of the sweaters I've got here.
	* Wash all my yarn **by hand**.
	* Design some labeling/packaging for this stuff.

If there's time to work on setting up the store, that'll be a nice bonus.
