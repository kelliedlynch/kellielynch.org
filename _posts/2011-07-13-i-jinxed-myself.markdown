I guess I should have known better than to talk about my low-maintenance car and auto repair prowess; I just blew out my transmission. Thankfully, it happened about 4 miles from home, and first gear still worked, so we weren't stuck in 90+ degree heat waiting for a tow truck. Driving home at 15 mph was less than fun, but it got us there eventually.

Time to see if this is something I should even attempt repairing myself.
