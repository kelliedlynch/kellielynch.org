Well, the craft center is clearly not getting done as quickly as I wanted, but I kind of expected that. I've been unusually busy lately. I got a part-time job; it's pretty dull, but that's kind of what I was looking for. With the amount of stuff I have to keep me occupied at home, the last thing I need is a bunch of job-related stress.

On top of that, I've been dating someone new, which is another huge time commitment. Of course there's the whole new-relationship giddy "I need to spend all of my free time with you" thing, but at the same time I need to make sure my family gets enough of my attention and time. I'm going out a lot, and making up for lost time when I get home. It's all highly enjoyable, but not very conducive to having a lot of free time for things like home improvement projects. Or writing blog posts.

Despite all that, my energy level has been pretty high. I felt a burst of inspiration earlier this week, and ended up churning out a long-ish stream-of-consciousness poem. I made a last-minute decision to go to my favorite coffee shop's open mic night and read it, since I was in town anyway. It seemed to go over well--it's hard to say for sure, since the crowd there is pretty generous with applause, but I felt I did a good job with the reading. And as long as I'm happy with it, that's all that's really important.

I'm actually writing this at the coffee shop while the rest of the performers do their bits. The open mic night organizer seemed to genuinely want me to come back next week, and right now I'm high on adrenaline and applause, so I really want to...I plan to if I can write something new. I'd feel a little weird coming back with just the poem I'd done the last week.
