Dora the Explorer's favorite "silly story" to tell is about the time her two infant siblings escaped from the house and rolled down the hill, and she and her parents had to chase them through some very dangerous terrain to get them back. When she tells everyone this, her parents, aunt and uncle, and grandmother all laugh uncontrollably.

I have some serious concerns about this family.
