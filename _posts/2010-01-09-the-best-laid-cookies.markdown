I was planning to post my recipe for the Best Peanut Butter Cookies Ever, complete with photos, but I didn't notice there was no memory card in the camera until I tried to get the photos off it. So, uh, here's some Avatar fanart instead?

Yeah, today's been kind of a waste. But at least I have cookies!
