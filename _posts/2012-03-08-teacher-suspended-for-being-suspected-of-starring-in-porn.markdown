Via the Huffington Post today: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/teacher-rumored-to-be-hardcore-porn-actress_n_1328020.html">Teacher Rumored To Be Hardcore Porn Actress, Removed From Classroom</a>. There is just so much wrong with this story, I hardly even know where to begin.

First off, what exactly is the point of blurring out the faces in the photo? We're talking about an internet porn video here--anyone who is going to recognize the film from one still image is probably going to do so with or without the faces. If you're really concerned about preserving anonymity, it might be better to just leave the images out entirely.

Now, my personal feeling is that a teacher is entitled to a life outside of school, and what she does in her spare time is her own damn business. And do we even know when this video was made? Complaining about a teacher moonlighting as a porn star is one thing--punishing her for what jobs she might have worked before wrangling unruly brats is another thing entirely. (Personally, I don't care if it's happening simultaneously, but I can kind of understand people complaining.)

All that aside--suspended because she's <em>suspected</em> of being a porn star? Seriously? You know, there's a <strong>lot</strong> of porn out there in the magical world of the internet. I would be willing to bet that just about any even moderately attractive woman has a porn star lookalike somewhere. Isn't it a little absurd to take action before you've even confirmed the rumors?

<blockquote>KTLA-TV reports that officials were alerted when students showed administrators a pornographic video allegedly starring the teacher.</blockquote>

Does this sound sketchy to anyone else? Keep in mind that this is a <em>middle school</em>. Picture this: you're a school administrator. A 13-year-old student comes up to you and says, "hey, I found a porn video that might have Miss Smith in it. Wanna see?" Do you really want to say yes? It just seems...remarkably unwise.

<blockquote> "We are asking teachers to discourage the children from searching for and/or visiting these inappropriate sites. We ask that you be particularly vigilant over the next few days with respect to the Internet content being accessed by your child on his or her telephone or other Internet-ready devices."

Superintendent Jeff Chancer told the Ventura County Star his main worry -- other than students trying to search for videos of the teacher -- is that it will disrupt productivity.</blockquote>

Oh, yeah, that's going to be effective. Because the best way to discourage students from looking at pornography on the internet is to call attention to it by <em>suspending a teacher over it.</em> You'd think if these people worked with teenagers all day, they'd have at least <em>some</em> idea of how they think.

<blockquote>Gerardo Sanchez, father of a 13-year-old student at the school, told KCAL-TV that he can't believe this is happening at his child's school.

â€œSchool is supposed to be a safe place," he told the station. "Now, you think twice because you never know what is going to happen."</blockquote>

Dude. <em>NOTHING HAPPENED.</em> This did not happen at school; the teacher did not behave in any inappropriate manner. Your children are as safe from the evils of pornography as they ever were...which is not at all. (Don't believe me? Remember, your kids were the ones who <em>found</em> this video.) The only thing that "happened" here is that school officials blew a non-issue way out of proportion, and made a scandal out of something that should have remained a stupid rumor passed around school by a bunch of horny kids.
