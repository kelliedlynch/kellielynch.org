This is really refreshing. I didn't know Margaret Cho was poly (or that she was married, honestly), but this is a great way to find out. She talks about it very openly and comfortably, and just seems to have a very reasonable, level-headed approach in general.

I'm amused at the way the other ladies are *almost* on board with all this, right up until she says "my husband's girlfriend"--then it's a little too much to handle, and a change of subject comes shortly afterward.
