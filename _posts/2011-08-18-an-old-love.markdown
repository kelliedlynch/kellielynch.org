I'm trying to get back into the theatre. I had my first audition in years today.

I flubbed the song pretty badly. I was so nervous that my voice wavered and cracked, and my pitch was off. The director stopped me after the first verse and had me do some scales instead. I screwed up a line early in my monologue, and about three quarters of the way through, my mind went completely blank. I felt the absurd urge to call "Line!" The director had me start over again, but this time with a Jersey accent. My Jersey accent was weak to begin with, and turned into a southern accent after a couple of lines.

It. Was. Awful.

I'm glad I did it, though. I need to get used to this if I really want to get on stage again. I've always hated auditions, but then, I'd never done enough of them to get comfortable with them.

There was talk of me perhaps being stage manager, though. I'm excited about the possibility, but I'd be a little relieved if it fell through--rehearsals are nearly an hour away. Still, if I'm looking for a way to get reacquainted with the theatre, this would be ideal...and fun.

In other news, I might have a date on Saturday. I'm meeting someone, but we haven't explicitly stated it's a date. We seem pretty compatible; I suppose if I meet him and find I'm physically attracted to him, I'll unilaterally declare it a date. So there.
