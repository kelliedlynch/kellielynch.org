Thunderstorms knocked out our internet today, so I'm giving posting from my phone a shot. Typing is a bit slow, but otherwise things seem to be going smoothly. We really are living in the future.

It's a cicada year, apparently, and so far all I know about cicadas is that they give me the willies. Okay, they're harmless, but watching these little buggers literally crawl out of their skin is just gross.

One of these days, one of these guys will land on my face, and I will break my own nose trying to kill it.

I spent most of the day destroying things--I sprayed herbicide on all the weeds in the yard, and did a bunch of demolition in the carport. A previous owner of this house built some largely useless storage out there (very wide closets accessible only by a narrow door), and I'm badly in need of space for a workbench and tool storage. The closets are built out of nice wide tongue and groove cedar planks, which sadly were then painted. I hate when people paint cedar; it's such a lovely wood. Now I need to figure out what, if anything, I want to do with a bunch of reclaimed painted cedar planks.

The carport, while not really any more attractive, is certainly quite a bit more functional. Attractiveness will come later...I hope.

Not really a before picture--just the storage area I haven&#39;t demolished for comparison.

After! Still needs a lot of work, but at least I can reach it all now.
