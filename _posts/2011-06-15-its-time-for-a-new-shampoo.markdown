I saw a bottle of shampoo in the store today that claimed, "Shampoo should clean your hair. A really good shampoo should leave you tingling from head to toe."

Er...if my shampoo left me tingling from head to toe, my first thought wouldn't be that it's a really good shampoo. My first thought would be that I might want to seek medical attention, because I could be having a catastrophic allergic reaction.
