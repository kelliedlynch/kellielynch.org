This little adventure in cooking came about because I had some potatoes, leeks, and corn that were all dangerously close to spoiling. Soups are such a great way to use up ingredients, and this one is nice and simple.

**Ingredients:**

* 6 medium potatoes
* 1 large leek
* 2 stalks celery
* 2 ears of corn
* 3 Tbsp. butter
* 8 (or so) cups stock
* 1 cup heavy cream

**Directions:**

Cook the corn in salted water for about 5 minutes. While the corn is cooking, chop the leek and saute in butter on low heat until soft.

Chop the potatoes into 1-inch cubes and add to the pan, then cover with stock and bring to a boil. Cut the corn off the cob and add the corn and celery to the pan. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 30 minutes, or longer if you can stand to.

Remove from heat. If you like a smoother soup, blend it a bit (I threw about half of it in my food processor). Stir in the cream and serve.

Mmm, soup! This made an enormous pot, so we'll have leftovers for lunch for a couple of days. The fresh-baked bread is courtesy of my husband--he does a fantastic loaf of no-knead bread when I can badger him into it.
