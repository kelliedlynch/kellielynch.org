Via <a href="http://www.mymoneyblog.com/virgin-mobile-25-a-month-plan-w-data-price-increase-on-july-20th.html">My Money Blog</a>, I learned that the Virgin Mobile $25 a month phone/data plan I love so much will be going up to $35 on July 20th. This is for new customers only; anyone who signs up before July 20th can keep the awesome $25 rate.

The husband and I both switched to Virgin a few months ago, and we've been more than happy with it. We don't use our phones as **phones** very often--we both got the <a href="http://www.virginmobileusa.com/cell-phones/lg-optimus-v-phone.jsp">LG Optimus V</a>, and we spend far more time tinkering around on the internet than calling people, so the 300 minute a month limit is no problem at all. I don't think either of us has come anywhere near it yet. But the convenience of having a smartphone--of having Google searches and a fully-functioning GPS unit in my pocket at all times--makes me wonder how I ever lived without one.

So if you've been considering making the switch to an Android phone, you really ought to check out Virgin before this gets away. $25 a month is a shockingly good value, especially for a no-contract month-to-month plan.
