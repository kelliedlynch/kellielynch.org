While I'm sick and miserable, I might as well post these photos from our trip to the botanical gardens two weeks ago. St. Louis has a wonderful botanical garden, something I really missed during my years in southern California. It just took me a few years in the desert to realize how much I missed green growing things.

There were enormous bumblebees everywhere.

Buzz buzz!

Here is a photo of some flowers. I am so original.

Purple is my favorite color.

She wasn't really trying to pet it, but this is still adorable.

I wish I had written down the names of some of these plants. All I can really say about them is "ooh, pretty!"

I love how this one came out. The colors are so vivid.
