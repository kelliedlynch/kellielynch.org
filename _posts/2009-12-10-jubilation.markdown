Hooray, I made my first sale! It was a skein of this pale yellow silk-and-cashmere blend:

This yarn was an absolute pleasure to work with, which is a good thing, since I need to unravel another skein of it now.

I still have a bunch of items to list, but David is out of town this week, leaving me to look after the baby on my own. It's hard to find time to sit at the computer when the little one is getting more and more mobile every day...and more and more fascinated with the cats' food dish.
