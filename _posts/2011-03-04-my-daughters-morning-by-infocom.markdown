**You are in the living room. There is a green couch on one end of the room, with a couple of throw blankets tossed haphazardly across it. There is a TV on the other end of the room. The TV is off. There are exits to the east and west.**

There is a Water-Wow doodle set, an empty cup, and a bottle of water here. You sure wish you could color.

&gt; get doodle set

You pick up the Water-Wow doodle set. The felt-tip pen and book of special paper allow curious toddlers to color mess-free--just add water!

&gt; use doodle set

You flip through the pages. Boring! You need water to use this properly.

You whine pathetically for a while. It seems that nobody hears you.

**You are in the study. It is very messy in here! There is a pillow in the corner covered in cat hair. There are exits to the east and west.**

&gt; say hi

You say hi to the cat. The cat ignores you.

I wouldn't do that if I were you!

There are three puzzle pieces here.

**You are in your parents' bedroom. Daddy blinks sleepily at you as you enter. Mommy is asleep and snoring quietly. There is a huge pile of dirty laundry in the corner that looks perfect for flopping down in. On one wall is a dresser with many drawers. In the corner is a wooden chair with a large boxlike seat. The top of the seat looks a little like a toybox lid.**

&gt; say hi

You say hi to Daddy. "Hi, what can I do for you?"

&gt; say help

You say help to Daddy. "I'm sorry, I don't know what you want help with."

&gt; say thank you

It looks like Mommy is starting to wake up.
