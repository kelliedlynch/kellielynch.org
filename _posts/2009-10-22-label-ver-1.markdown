I managed to whip up something I'm fairly happy with here. I wanted a label template that I could use for all the yarn I sell, with space for all the important details about the yarn, and the URL of my Etsy store and blog.

I'm not 100% sure about the name, but "Kellie's Unhealthy Obsession With Yarn" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
