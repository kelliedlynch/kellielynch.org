<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/help_haiti/">help_haiti</a> is a LiveJournal community where people offer up items for auction to help relief efforts for the Haiti earthquake. Bids are placed in comments, and the high bidder makes a donation of that amount to any one of <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/help_haiti/660.html">these listed charities</a>. Once the donation is verified, the "seller" sends out the item.

I thought the idea was quite clever, so I'm offering up <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/help_haiti/2138.html?thread=3596378#t3596378">one custom-made Kindle case</a>. The winner will choose what colors and materials I use, what type of closure it has, and give me some idea of the style they're looking for, and I'll see what I can whip up!

This might be a good time for me to prune some of my bookshelves, too...
