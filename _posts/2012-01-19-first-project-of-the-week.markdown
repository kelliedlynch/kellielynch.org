I actually did finish this in a week (plus or minus a day)--I just didn't post about it. I have been uncharacteristically busy lately.

So, this week's project was to tailor this vest for a more flattering fit, and add more buttons.

Step one: tear it open! I had to remove some trim to get at the insides.

Now I pin and mark the darts. The vest fits well in the bust, so it just needs to be brought in at the waist. For a trim fit, I need to remove about 5 inches, most of it in the back.

Once the darts are sewn, they need to be pressed. I then go to my handy-dandy ironing board:

...also known as a towel on the dining room table. I need to buy an ironing board one of these days.

There isn't a big enough opening in the vest to slip it over the corner of the table, and I don't want to press wrinkles into the layers underneath what I'm working on, so I just folded a hand towel in thirds.

It goes up inside to keep me from screwing up the bottom layer of fabric while I press darts.

After the darts are pressed, the trim gets stitched back on.

Next: buttons! There are only four on this vest, and if there's one thing I know about steampunk, it's that you can never have too many buttons. I really should have taken a picture of the buttons, but I forgot. Here's the vest with pins marking where the new button loops go.

And with the fancier and more plentiful buttons sewn on, this vest is now fit for...<em>Kellie Lynch, Lady of Adventure!</em>

Side view. You can really see the shaping the darts have added here.

Success! Now to decide what I'm going to work on this week...
