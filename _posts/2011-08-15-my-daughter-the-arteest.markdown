I've been rediscovering watercolors lately. I used to really enjoy working with watercolor pencils, but hadn't done much with just brush and paint. I did this just to play with colors and shapes, and kind of get used to the medium:

Yesterday my husband woke me with the news that my 2-year-old daughter had found my newest in-progress painting and "improved" it. Specifically, she had assumed it was a coloring book page that needed some more color, so she took a red colored pencil to it. As anyone who has worked with colored pencils knows, they do NOT erase well. Especially when applied with the grace and finesse of a toddler. Here's what it looks like now.

I probably should have taken a photo of the piece before I started trying to erase it, but frankly, I wasn't in a very good state of mind to see the humor in the situation. Thankfully, the pencil erased more easily from the bits with more paint on them, so I was able to mostly remove the red from the girl on the bottom. It was harder to remove the red "aura" around her--I had to use an X-acto knife and carefully scrape away the top layer of paper. I just hope that the scraped paper will accept watercolor somewhat uniformly.

The face is still grainy and red-speckled, and I'm not sure I want to risk trying to fix it. My current plan is to give the entire upper half of the painting up as lost, redo it on another sheet of paper, and Photoshop the whole thing together. Not quite what I was hoping for, but I guess it could have been worse.

She could have gotten hold of my paints.
