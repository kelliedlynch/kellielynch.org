Sometimes it seems like all I ever do is re-evaluate my goals and priorities. It's a productive and healthy thing to do on occasion, but I switch directions so often that sometimes I barely recognize myself from one month to the next.

I wrote a little while ago about [accepting my role as a housewife](/2011/09/19/constant-overwork/) and not expecting too much of myself. Once again, I haven't been feeling like I'm accomplishing enough, but this time it's because I'm really not. I started playing WoW again a couple months ago, and since then it's been a rare day that I've gotten through my entire cleaning checklist. The good news is that I've spent the last 3 1/2 weeks out of town, and after that long cold turkey, I find my desire to play is almost nil. I still haven't gotten through the cleaning in the couple of days since I've returned, but that's because I've been unpacking and settling in. I'm okay with that.

On the other hand, I still have a strong desire to earn some money. Housewife I may be, but I still want to go on vacations and build up a bigger savings. I've applied for a part-time job near home, which would certainly satisfy that goal, but I have been finding that I also miss the creative outlet that selling on [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com) provided. I mean, it never really made me money, but it was fun, and it did let me justify buying a whole bunch of craft supplies. That's always a plus.

So my new goal is to get [my Etsy shop](http://kellielynch.etsy.com) stocked and running again. To that end, I want to do at least one project a week. I've been on a steampunk kick lately, so I'm going to start off with a couple of steampunky projects, but I'll probably also get back into [Kindle cases](/2010/01/03/kindle-cases) and [recycled yarn](/2009/12/10/jubilation).

Project number one is something I'm probably going to keep, though. It's this vest:

I picked this as the first project because it's really simple: I just need to tailor it for a more flattering fit. A couple of darts should do it, and maybe I'll add more buttons. When it's finished, I'll see if it looks good with the rest of my steampunk convention wardrobe...and if not, into the store it goes!
