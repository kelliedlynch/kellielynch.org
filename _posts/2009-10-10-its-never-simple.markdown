I've spent a few days winding yarn around my hands, my arm, a cutting board, a table, and whatever else is handy, and I've concluded that I need three things:

* a niddy-noddy
* a yarn swift
* a ball winder

Since any one of these items could run me $30-$80, it's time for some DIY options.

The niddy-noddy is the easiest by far. There are a couple of sites around that describe how to <a href="http://www.doctordirt.com/blog/niddy.html">make a niddy-noddy from PVC pipe</a>. I love PVC pipe--I built some furniture out of it a couple weeks ago (and it hasn't collapsed yet!).

Next is the swift. This is a little trickier, but I found <a href="http://www.craftydiversions.com/patterns/homemade_yarn_swift.htm">a lovely tutorial</a> for making a homemade one. I've got some scrap wood in the basement, but I might buy some precut pieces instead--all I've got to cut with is a jigsaw, and I can't cut a straight line with that to save my life.

And finally, the ball winder. I found a site that sells <a href="http://lisaboyer.com/Claytonsite/yarnpackagepage.htm">woodworking plans</a> for a ball winder and swift. Sadly, the package of plans is $30, which is more than I want to spend on an experiment. However, after inspecting the photos carefully, I think I can improvise something similar.

It looks like today is a good day for a trip to Lowe's!
